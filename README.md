        SAVE-LIFES
Description
"Save Lifes," a MERN stack project, was motivated by the challenges faced by Ethiopians unable to pay for medical care. It's a GoFundMe-like portal created especially for patients in need. Logging in allows users to upload medical bills and hospital approval letters and request financial aid. 
The project uses Node.js/Express for the backend, React and Bootstrap for the frontend, and MongoDB for the database. States, routing, and route protection were handled using React technologies including functional components, react-router-dom, and hooks like useState, useEffect, and useRef. Jwt-tokens were utilised for secure authentication, and Axios was used to retrieve API data.
I used Express.js to create a RESTful API on the backend, integrating jwt-tokens for safe authorization and authentication.
